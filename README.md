## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional dependencies required

## 🎯 How It Works

The clock uses JavaScript's `Date()` object to get the current time and updates the display every second using `setInterval()`. The time is formatted and displayed in a user-friendly 12-hour format with AM/PM indicators.
